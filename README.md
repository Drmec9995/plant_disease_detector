# plant_disease_detector
### This is a project that constist of a web app using streamlit for prediction of plant diseases.
Although the functionality of the project is limited due to the inability to access a good data for this project but i can alway do better if 
data are available.

#### PLANT DISEASE DECTECTION
problem statement...
Plant diseases have always been a challenge to plant growth and crop production in several parts of the world. Plant diseases can affect plants by interfering with several processes such as the absorbance and translocation of water and nutrients, photosynthesis, flower and fruit development, plant growth and development and cell division and enlargement. Plant diseases can be caused by different types of fungi, bacteria, phytoplasma, viruses, viroids, nematodes and other agents. The severity of diseases caused by these pathogens varies from mild symptoms to decline of the infected plants, depending on the aggressiveness of the pathogen, host resistance, environmental conditions, duration of infection and other factors.[1] Plant disease symptoms vary with the infecting pathogen and the infected part and can include leaf spots, leaf blights, root rots, fruit rots, fruit spots, wilt, dieback and decline.

Plant disease: a threat to global food security by
Richard N Strange 1, Peter R Scott

A vast number of plant pathogens from viroids of a few hundred nucleotides to higher plants cause diseases in our crops. Their effects range from mild symptoms to catastrophes in which large areas planted to food crops are destroyed. Catastrophic plant disease exacerbates the current deficit of food supply in which at least 800 million people are inadequately fed. Plant pathogens are difficult to control because their populations are variable in time, space, and genotype. Most insidiously, they evolve, often overcoming the resistance that may have been the hard-won achievement of the plant breeder. In order to combat the losses they cause, it is necessary to define the problem and seek remedies. At the biological level, the requirements are for the speedy and accurate identification of the causal organism, accurate estimates of the severity of disease and its effect on yield, and identification of its virulence mechanisms. Disease may then be minimized by the reduction of the pathogen's inoculum, inhibition of its virulence mechanisms, and promotion of genetic diversity in the crop. Conventional plant breeding for resistance has an important role to play that can now be facilitated by marker-assisted selection. There is also a role for transgenic modification with genes that confer resistance. At the political level, there is a need to acknowledge that plant diseases threaten our food supplies and to devote adequate resources to their control.

I worked on this project so we can build an app that works on our smartphone which can quickly detect the type of disease affecting our farm produce, this will reduce the amount of farm produce that will be lost to farm diseases. it will help us to control disease infection in farm at early stage. It will also improve the farm yield sice we are detecting the disease at its early stage.

* Step to solve the problem:
* importing the image on our notebook.
* extracting the images in jupyter notebook.
* visualizing the image that we will be working on.
* converting the image into a numpyarray and normalizing them
* checking class imbalance
* splitting the data and performing one-hot encoding.
* creating modl architecture, compliling the model and then fitting it.
* plotting the accuracy and loss against each epoch
* preprocessing the test data and making prediction on it.
* visualizing the original and predictd labels for the test images.

* ### building a streamlit App for the plant disease detection
